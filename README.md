# PERManentResidency

### Taking a look at how applications for US permeant residency have changed in tandem with changes in the US political sphere using US Department of Labor data.

Given recent changes in the US political climate, immigration has become a central and heated part of American Political discourse. As this discussion has become increasingly negative and confrontational towards those who are looking to come to the United States to work, we would anticipate some impact on us immigration. The purpose of this project is to examine the permeant residency application data and note any changes since the election.

## Data Sources
The data I am using in this project comes from the United States Department of Labor and can be found [here](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm). I have pulled data from 2015, 2016, and 2017 to begin taking a look.
